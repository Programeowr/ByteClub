- Implemented Stalls
- Implemented branch instructions 

Date : 8-Mar-2025

Members: V Sai Akhil, E Rishikesh Reddy 

Decisions:
- Tried solving the problems arose due to the usage of threads
- Couldn't solve them since new problems arose after one another

Date: 6-Mar-2025

Members: V Sai Akhil, E Rishikesh Reddy 

Decisions:
- Implemented Stalls
- Implemented branch instructions 
- Problems arose due to the unpredictability of threads

Date: 4-Mar-2025

Members: V Sai Akhil, E Rishikesh Reddy 

Decisions: 
- Learned threads
- Implemented pipelines using threads in Sample.cpp
- Implemented basic instructions 

Date: 2-Mar-2025

Members: V Sai Akhil, E Rishikesh Reddy 

Decisions: 
- Decided to use threads to simulate the pipelining.
- Decided to copy the project and make a new file and experiment in it. (Sample.cpp)

Date: 19-Feb-2025
